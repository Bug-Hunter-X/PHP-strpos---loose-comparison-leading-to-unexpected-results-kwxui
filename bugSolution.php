The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). This ensures that `false` (substring not found) is not incorrectly treated as `0` (substring found at the beginning).

```php
<?php
$string = 'This is a test string.';

if (strpos($string, 'test') === 0) {
    echo 'Found at the beginning!';
} else {
    echo 'Not found at the beginning.';
}

$string2 = 'This is another test.';

if (strpos($string2, 'search') === 0) {
    echo '\nFound at the beginning!';
} else {
    echo '\nNot found at the beginning.';
}
?>
```

By using strict comparison, the code correctly identifies whether the substring is found at the beginning of the string or not found at all.
